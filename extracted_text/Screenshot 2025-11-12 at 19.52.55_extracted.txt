For many years, | think | got life wrong.
| thought happiness was a new fund, a new investment, a new
opportunity.
Now | realize life is focusing on the small but important things that truly
matter.
The weekly marathon walks with my mother are one of the highlights of
my week.
To every mother; we so appreciate you and couldn't do what we do
without you.
To everyone, call your mama and tell them how much you love them. One
day, you won't be able to and you will always regret not making that call.
